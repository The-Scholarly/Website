									<h2>Abstract</h2>

									<p>Lipases are key biocatalysts involved in transesterification processes as common strategies for producing biodiesel as an alternate fuel source within the bio-energy sector. However, new strategies need to be developed to help increase the commercial viability of lipases therefore new novel lipases need to be researched and commercial limitations need to be overcome. The aim of this research was to generate solutions from simulations, based on published literature, of ideal physiological parameters resulting in the highest yields of lipases for end use. These parameters could then be tested in future research to determine lipase viability. Alongside this, ideas of industrial strategies were also explored to determine commercial impact of lipases usage and the response of pursuing this technology on areas such as economic feasibility and agricultural pressures.</p>
								  <p>The use of statistical simulations has helped to generate predictive models which can be used to discover viable lipase solutions based upon the existing Bacillus and Pseudomonas genera. These models have been used to find specific trends in overall yield of biodiesel in response to temperature, pH and feedstocks. Bacillus models indicated that yields of 82% were achievable in response to the lower physiological values such as pH 7 and a temperature of 35oC, making them highly appropriate as biocatalysts within industry for biodiesel. The Pseudomonas simulation also resulted in high, consistent yields but also showed how different feedstocks, such as olive and soya bean oil, in combination with physiological parameters affect pH and temperature can affect the overall theoretical yield of lipases.</p>
								 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	                              <p>Fuel security and environmental degradation are growing concerns and there is an increase in finding ‘carbon neutral’ solutions to combat the high carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration within the atmosphere. Alongside environmental uncertainties, increasing demand for fossil fuels as the primary energy source has resulted in additional consequences in increasing crude oil prices and economic instability (Escobar-Niño et al., 2014). Therefore, one possible solution is production of alternative biofuels to help by reduce atmospheric CO2 levels from fossil fuel usage. Alongside this, these fuels should be sustainable in catering for increasing energy consumption and help to reduce global dependence on fossil fuels (Tripathi et al., 2014).</p>

                                  <p>Figure 2: General esterification reaction</p>
<p>Biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl ester) is the attractive product as it is non-toxic, renewable and biodegradable (Huang et al., 2015). It is a form of fatty acid alkyl esters stemming from the reaction of using oils/fats and recently been produced via a variety or chemical and enzymatic methods. Both fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are desirable products of biodiesel and produced via transesterification and esterification reactions (Fig 1, Fig 2). Both reactions are frequently used in a two-step manner, with esterification reducing free fatty acids (FFA) levels followed by transesterification for oil to be completely converted to triacylglycerols (Escobar-Niño et al., 2014). This is due to limited efficiency of transesterification via high percentages of fatty acids (FA) and FFAs in the substrate oil, resulting in saponification (Demirbas, 2009). This is a common problem of non-edible waste oils, which would be the convenient source of oil given its low cost (Amini et al., 2017). Alongside this, converting FFAs stems from the inefficiencies of using crude vegetable oil, which contains a high level of both, and is poorly incorporated into existing mechanical systems (i.e. car engines) hence the need for the two-step reactions (Bünger et al., 2016).</p>
								  <p>Biodiesel has many useful properties as an energy source. The high biodegradability and low toxicity mean that it causes less damage than petroleum-based diesel, whist still being implemented into existing processes like combustion engines with a minimal decrease in performance and change to existing systems (Kuan et al., 2013; Atabani et al., 2012). Alongside this, blending of conventional fuel with biodiesel results in a reduction of CO2 emission issues and research estimates that biodiesel is 66% more efficient as a lubricant (Atabani et al., 2012). Other useful features include a higher flash point than diesel fuel and therefore can be regarded as safer when it comes to storage and transportation, two very important aspects within industrial processes (Yücel et al., 2012).</p>
<h3><em>Feedstock Effects</em></h3>
								  <p>Feedstocks for biodiesel production can be considered as relatively varied with the capability of being forms of vegetable and microbial oils and animal fats (Sankaran et al., 2016). Vegetable oils are considered one of the best due to the lower free fatty acid content and higher quality compared to other oils. Some oils, such as olive and soya bean oil, are known as first-generation feedstocks and used within the biofuel production as they are generally well understood within research. However, a crucial problem currently is that most of these oils are edible and raises the concern for the food vs. fuel debate and food security (Vargas et al., 2018).</p>
								  <p>Olive and soya bean oil were selected as they are common and widely understood oils, used highly in biofuel development as a feedstock. Olive oil production is significant in agricultural activity, acting as a staple of economy for some countries, particularly Mediterranean. However, olive oil processing (olive mill process) results in high amounts of waste product called orujo and alpeorujo which have high polluting properties and phototoxic activity (Yousuf et al., 2010). These risks are important factors to consider when using olive oil. Despite this, most of the current research involves these edible feedstocks as substrates for lipases within the reactions, making them relevant to analyse within the biofuel process (Atadashi et al., 2012).</p>
<h3><em>Lipases as biocatalysts</em></h3>
								  <p>The ‘greener-approaches’ rely on natural chemical catalysis and biocatalysts like enzymes, generally attained from microorganisms, to reduce environmental footprints when producing biofuels (Jain et al., 2015). Lipases are one of the most diverse enzymes within biotechnological situations with several unique features such as: substrate specificity, stability within extreme temperatures and pH levels (Gricajeva et al., 2016). They are stable serine hydrolases and act on ester bonds within carboxylic esters, and can naturally hydrolyse triacylglycerols within fats, giving them functional roles in many areas from pharmaceuticals, detergents and biofuels (Malekabadi et al., 2018; Vélez et al., 2013).</p>
<span class="image"><img src="images/Lipase uses and advantages.jpg" alt=""/>
								  <p>Figure 3: Lipase uses and advantages (Kumar et al., 2016)</p>
								  <p>They have many attractive features (Fig. 3) and can convert FFAs to biodiesel in the presence of water unlike in chemical transesterification. Lipases can also be easily separated from glycerol, which limits contamination and can contribute to economic stability as a valuable by-product, perhaps even lowering the cost of biodiesel production (Korman et al.,2013). The ideal commercial and effective lipase would have qualities such as: usage of all intermediates (mono, di, triglycerides) of FFAs, short reaction time, recyclability and achievable physiological parameters like pH and temperature (Sankaran et al., 2016). The synthesis of biofuel can be done in organic solvent media via the transesterification process, involving lipases as biocatalysts, alongside various oils and the presence of alcohol (Tripathi et al., 2014).</p>
<h3><em>Physiological parameters</em></h3>
								  <p>Temperature affects are important in enzymes as it affects energy transfer and collision rates between substrates and the active sites of individual enzymes. However, it is known that if temperature levels exceed optimum, active site and protein stability is degraded and the enzyme will fail to function (Fan et al., 2012). Temperature is also important for transesterification as the reaction rate constant (E + S ↔ ES → E + P) is a function of temperature, therefore temperature can directly affect the speed of a reaction (Qiu et al., 2011).</p>
								  <p>Alongside this, pH changes will also have similar affects as the importance of ionic interactions, especially within the active site, are critical in protein stability. The isoelectric point (pI) is important in maintaining no net charge however, changes in pH will deviate this point and affect enzyme functionality, altering conformation and solubility between folded states. Both may result in aggregation of the proteins and both factors together can influence overall enzyme capabilities (Rajakumara et al., 2008).</p>
								  <p>These parameters are very important in enzyme functionality and are early key factors to consider when using a specific enzyme. If these conditions are not optimal, they can hinder reactions from the start, which is especially problematic within the biodiesel process (Hwang et al., 2014). Other factors can also hinder performance such as folding issues involving host specific chaperones and use of alcohols which result in lipase inhibition through active site conformational changes. Therefore, despite many advantageous aspects of lipases, they still lack perfect integration within current systems (Al‐Zuhair, 2007). However, temperature and pH parameters need to be well established before further analysis is required within biofuel synthesis processes.</p>
								  <p>The objective of the present project was to analyse the influence of different physiological parameters in the production of lipases from various organisms for the ultimate end use within biofuel synthesis, specifically biodiesel. These factors include the feedstocks, temperature and pH affecting the overall efficiency of lipases as catalysis in biodiesel production, analysed through simulations and models. Additionally, this paper will discuss the current problems with the commercial application of these lipases within this sector and how future improvements may help to develop their usage in sustainable fuel production.</p>
								  <p>Finally, informational power is defined as using information that does not belong to the individual to influence others. This type of power is not used by ministers as all the information is provided by higher powers, an example being Rome for the Roman Catholics. Therefore, ministers are able to provide information, but not keep it as their own, as the information is distilled equally throughout different congregations.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Through the understanding of the bases of power, this could be the reason as to how and why ministers have influence over the congregation. In relation to sexual health, it has been published that ministers are seen to be an essential element for health interventions (Bopp, Baruth, Peterson &amp; Webb, 2013). The minister can do this at three different prevention levels: tertiary, such as being in contact with hospitals and the individuals families, secondary by identifying sexual health disorders or primary such as leading sexual health promotion programs (Levin, 1986). This demonstrates that not only do ministers do have an influence, they can specifically impact the sexual wellbeing of their congregations.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Although there is an understanding that ministers may have the power and authority to be able to influence members of their congregations, there needs to be an understanding of the type of person that can be influenced. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to measure personality traits and minister influence. Therefore, personality traits were compared to compliance (Gudjonsson, 1989; Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, Bragason, Einarsson &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 2004) and other behaviours relating to compliance such as information seeking (Halder, Roy &amp; Chakraborty, 2017). Horney’s (2012) definition of individuals with a compliant personality is that they want to feel loved, accepted and appreciated. Individuals also want to be cared for, protected and guided by others. These individuals are sensitive to other people’s needs in their social environment.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Previous research has published that neuroticism is positively associated with compliance, whereas extraversion is negatively associated with compliance amongst 3 different sample types (Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, Bragason, Einarsson &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 2004). It could be argued that neuroticism and introversion combined, leads to an insecure personality which would lead them to want to be accepted and guided. These facts are ideal within a religious adherence as religion is traditionally very accepting, allowing anyone to join and the minister can provide guidance to the insecure individual. Therefore, it is hypothesised that high neuroticism and low extraversion would lead to minister compliance and minister influence on individuals sexual and moral behaviour if guided on these topics.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Agreeableness was also published to have a positive association with compliance through informational seeking behaviour amongst a student population (Halder, Roy &amp; Chakraborty, 2017). Through information seeking, it could be suggested that students may go to religious ministers to increase understanding of their religion. To accept the ministers’ viewpoints, the students must be receptive to information being shared to them, therefore agreeableness needs to be measured in the current study, to see if the minister has influence on sexual attitudes and not just religious teachings.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Not only does the personality types impact the effectiveness of minister influence, the same personality types also impact the individuals’ sexual behaviour. Previous research has published that around 60% of females report compliant sexual behaviours with unwanted sexual advances such as unwanted dancing, kissing, petting, oral sex, and vaginal intercourse (Kennett, Humphreys, &amp; Bramley, 2013; O’Sullivan &amp; Allgeier, 1998). Additionally, the issue on compliance can affect males (Quinn-Nilas et al, 2013). Due to this being a recent issue, the current research is interested whether compliance is higher in congregational members leading to a change in sexual behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>When looking at personality traits from the Big Five, previous research has published that people who had a highly neurotic personality tended to have more permissive sexual attitudes (Fernandez &amp; Castro, 2003). Individuals with high neuroticism also seemed to engage in more sexual risk-taking behaviour (Eysenck, 1971; Naff Johnson, 1997) such as unsafe sexual practices (Cerwonka, Isbell &amp; Hansen, 2000), and not using a condom to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (Holmes, Levine &amp; Weaver, 2004).&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>As well as neuroticism, extraversion has also been seen to have a positive link with permissive sexual attitudes and desires (Barnes, Malamuth, &amp; Cheek, 1984; Costa, Fagan, Piedmont, Ponticas, &amp; Wise, 1992; Snyder, Simpson, &amp; Gangestad, 1986). Extraversion also has been linked to promiscuous sexual behaviour (Pinkerton &amp; Abramson, 1995; Schenk &amp; Pfrang, 1986; Schmitt &amp; Buss, 2000; Wright, 1999) and to unsafe sexual practices (McCown, 1992). The reason that extraversion is seen to be linked with permissive sexual attitudes, could be due to the individuals having a higher libido which causes them to want to have more sexual experiences.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Finally, it has also been published that low agreeableness has been linked to unrestricted sociosexual orientation (Wright and Reise, 1997). Sociosexual orientation is defined as the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a restricted sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex whereas individuals with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex, and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness (Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991). Therefore, an unrestricted sociosexual orientation is linked to permissive sexual attitudes which also suggests that low agreeableness is linked to permissive sexual behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
