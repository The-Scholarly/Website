									<h2>The Story So Far</h2>

									<p>I have been part of the fabric of academia my entire life. Both my parents were teachers and I knew I wanted to be an academic psychologist from the age of 15, when I did some work experience in a nursery. I rose through my undergraduate and post graduate courses with flying colours, earning a First-Class Honours degree and subsequent Distinction at Masters level. While moving towards my PhD scholarship and looking at publishing my first dissertation, I wondered to myself ‘How do academics make money?’ Using my acquired research skills from years of working and studying at a university institution, I researched and found to my dismay, that for academic articles, academic writers do not make any income. This was shocking to me. Throughout my early academic career, I have had the understanding that if a person worked hard, they should get rewarded for their hard work. Not only do academic writers not make money, but they pay publishing companies an Article Processing Charge (APC) to publish their work as open access. In one hand academic writers are some of the most selfless people on this planet. They spend their own money or their grant money to publish their work and further the reaches of science. These authors are so selfless in their actions that the speed of science is moving closer to the speed of light with each passing day. On the other hand, in order to make ends meet, academic writers have to submit themselves, not only to writing academic articles but, for the few, writing books which can take years to complete and only provide pittance in royalties on top of their shrinking salary. And who must pay for these books? It is none other than the students of the very universities the authors teach at. For money-deficient individuals like students, a single £50-60 book is too expensive. University courses may require 3-5 books per year. This is unsustainable for the student. This creates a cycle of punishment at all levels. If the academic doesn’t produce high quality academic articles, they could get demoted or fired. The academics don’t get paid to write articles; they get paid to teach students. The more high quality papers academics write, the institution gains more reputation to bid for grants which the academics then have to compete over. To overcome competition, some academics must plug their own books to students on their courses so they can make that 9% royalty which can equate to £100 or less. In the UK, academic writers earn the lowest annual averages from their books of any type of writer. In this system everyone loses, and the big publishing companies win. So now we have a problem in the academic circle, what is the solution?</p>
									

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Solution</h2>
									<p>The solution is simple. Provide academics with royalties for the academic journal articles. This royalty system must be passive, and academics must be able to receive these royalties over time throughout their entire academic career, from their first paper to their last paper. These royalties should not be connected to the institution. If the academic has moved or been let go, they will still receive a passive income until they find another position. The new publishing company that I propose is one which does not charge an academic APC but instead gives back to the author instead. This will give the author motivation to continue publishing under the new company, expanding the window of knowledge in the process.</p>
									<p>But how can this be done, how does the publishing company make enough funds to continue growing while supporting academics? Advertising. Advertising provides passive income to both the company and the authors. Appropriate adverts will be used on the website that hosts the academic authors work, which will generate income. As part of the submission guidelines, the author is required to provide a 10-minute video summarising their academic article instead of an APC.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why is this so important?</h2>
									<p>Adverts can be imbedded into the video at three separate points and each of these adverts will generate passive income over time for the publishing company and the author. From the videos, the author will be provided 33% of the royalties and with each video watched, even years from now that income is still provided. If the author does not want their video to be accessible, the company will give them this option, as long as they are aware they will not be receiving royalties for that particular article.</p>
									

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why Videos?</h2>
									<p>Who would watch the videos when the publishing company provides an open source journal article? The answer is time-deficient individuals. This could be a professor who wants to talk about the latest research available 30 minutes before a conference call (COVID-19) or a student who needs a quick video before his essay is due the next day. Because the authors are creating these videos, there is an innate guarantee that the information will be genuine and accurate with a suitable reference being linked to the corresponding academic paper. There is also another audience for these videos. Everyone. If the 10-minute author created video is too complicated for lay people, the publishing company would be able to hire graduates of MSc Science Communication degrees. This will create jobs in the sector, allowing for simplification of the videos, so everyone can understand cutting edge science, as it happens. The common person would no longer need to use ‘News’ sources which simplify and twist the truth in the name of entertainment and views. The common person would be able to prove their own points backed up with real research. The vision of this company is: People who put in the work deserve the reward and everyone is entitled to knowledge. With this design, the world’s population has true access to all knowledge.</p>
