									<h2>Abstract</h2>

									<p>Aims: There is insufficient evidence on whether religious institutions influence congregation members on sexual and moral behaviour. A key figure who has direct contact with congregation members are ministers therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand ministers’ views and measure them against the attitudes of the congregation members. This is done through two studies using qualitative and psychometric methods.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;Design and Method: Study A consisted of a thematic analysis (TA) with nine ministers. Interviews ranging from 1-2 hours were conducted with a range of open questions. These interviews were administered within the churches that the ministers identified with.&nbsp;To predict sexual attitudes a questionnaire was developed and consisted of the following variables: minister influence, charismatic leadership, moral behaviour, religiousness, compliance and The Big Five personality traits. The criterion variables were sexual attitudes. The data were collected (N~46) via a questionnaire which encompassed psychometric measures from each of the predictors and criterion variables.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;Results: Study A established 2 discrete but interacting themes. (1) influence or personal choice and (2) ministers as translators. The themes described how the ministers understood they have partial influence over their congregation but are careful not to exploit that influence. Additionally, the ministers understand that the free will of the congregation is important, and so hesitate when interpreting the word of god, due to fearing their own interpretations. For study B, models between the predictor variables and permissive and instrumental sexual attitudes were significant. Openness to experience had a positive association with permissive sexual attitudes. For Instrumental sex attitudes, compliance and extraversion had a positive association and religiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism had a negative association.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;Conclusions: In summary, study A established that ministers feel they have influence over their congregation members, however they are careful on how they apply their influence, due to sexual behaviour being a sensitive matter which impacts individuals independently. Additionally, ministers are cautious when interpreting holy scriptures personally, as they&nbsp;are worried about causing further schisms, reducing the level of influence they have on their congregations. Study A’s findings support the results in study B as it was found that ministers do not have an influence on the sexual attitudes of the congregation. This could further be explained by the ministers’ respect of the congregation’s free will. This respect of the free will may indicate the ministers do not preach about sexual matters in sermons out of respect of the members individual circumstances. This would allow the congregations personal religious beliefs and personality to dictate what sexual attitudes are permissible for them, which is found in study B’s outcomes.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	                              <p>In recent history, there has been an interest in the changing perceptions of sexual attitudes and its effect on moral behaviour within society. Casual sex has been increasing consistently compared to previous generations (Monto &amp; Carey, 2014; Fincham &amp; May, 2017), and is thought to affect the mental and physical wellbeing of individuals. Previous research has published that casual sex has a negative association with psychological wellbeing, whilst positively correlating with psychological stress (Vrangalova, 2015). Additionally, in the case of autonomous and non-autonomous casual sexual behaviours, people having casual sex for autonomous reasons were, for the most part, unaffected by this activity, whereas those who engaged in casual sex for non-autonomous reasons typically experienced a decrease in psychological wellbeing (Vrangalova, 2015). Autonomous sexual behaviours exist due to the pleasure of the act itself rather than using the act to achieve other goals such as finding a long-term partner from a casual sex encounter. Consequently, non-autonomous sexual behaviour is particularly problematic for society, as there is a measurable deficit in wellbeing which could lead to shame, depression and lowered self-esteem (Vrangalova, 2015). Therefore, it can be argued that sex needs to be discussed in detail to understand its affect comprehensively.&nbsp;</p>
	                              <p>One-way sexuality can be defined, is the capacity for sexual feelings where an individual understands the identity of their sexual self (Snell Jr &amp; Papini, 1989). The second definition is a person’s sexual orientation or preference. These two definitions have a cooperation between them, as to develop a sexual orientation or preference, there must first be an understanding of sexual emotion. The third definition of sexuality is the action of sexual activity which is linked to the individual’s sexual attitudes (Bartellas, Crane, Daley, Bennett &amp; Hutchens, 2000; Odimegwu, 2005). This is seen as the sexual behaviour of the individual.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Regarding, the first and second definitions, there are opposing theories on how sexual orientation is developed. There is evidence to assert that sexual orientation has a biological origin, which suggests that genetics has a strong influence, inferring that sexuality is predetermined (Joslyn &amp; Haider‐Markel, 2016). However, opposing research has reported that sexuality is a choice of the individual (Santona &amp; Tognasso, 2018) and this allows an individual’s sexuality to change. Currently, there is an interest in this debate as previous research has looked at the inclusion of homosexual congregation members in the churches (Quinn, Dickson-Gomez &amp; Young, 2016) and whether they are treated differently in the church setting. There seems to be a ‘don’t ask don’t tell’ premise in the attitude of the church when regarding homosexuality (Quinn, Dickson-Gomez &amp; Young, 2016). However, as this focuses on the attitude of the church rather than the ministers’ attitude, the current study could see if the ministers’ views differ from the collective church. If this is the case, it would be interesting to note whether the ministers share their views, to change the opinions of congregation members who feel that homosexual behaviour is sinful.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;The focus of the current project will be based on the third definition, with the sexual attitudes of the congregation used to understand their behaviour. It is known that attitudes can influence the behaviour of an individual (Sheeran et al, 2016), therefore instead of directly asking about sexual behaviour, due to the sensitive nature of the topic (Bourne &amp; Robson, 2015; Harling et al, 2017), the current project will look at sexual attitudes. When reviewing previous research on sexual attitudes, an emergence of different types of sexual attitudes, namely permissive and instrumental attitudes, became apparent.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Hendrick &amp; Hendrick (1987) defines sexual instrumentality as a natural, biological, self-oriented aspect of life. As instrumental sexual attitude is regarded as natural and self-orientated, this suggests that individuals with an instrumental sexual attitude are more likely to have sex to please themselves. This is supported by Leary &amp; Snell Jr (1988) who published that instrumental sexual attitude is associated with the frequency of sexual intercourse, oral sex and the number of sexual partners. Additionally, Brown, Conner &amp; Vennum (2017) suggested that instrumental sexual attitudes were higher among classes of men and women that viewed pornography primarily for sexual pleasure. In this sense, instrumental sexual attitude is used to provide exclusive personal fulfilment, rather than used in a relational dynamic in traditional circumstances (Hendrick, Hendrick &amp; Reich, 2006).&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Permissive sexual attitudes are defined as a more relaxed approach towards sexuality, allowing more freedom in expression. With a permissive attitude you are more lenient or tolerant towards casual sexual behaviour such as, having sex before marriage or having sex without being in love (Buning, 2013). Evidence of this is supported by Kaestle &amp; Evans (2017), who demonstrated that in college, women who had a permissive sexual attitude tended to have a high sense of sexual wellbeing when engaging in casual sex. However, women who held permissive sexual attitudes but did not have any recent sex, had the lowest sexual well-being scores. This indicates that individuals who have a permissive sexual attitude not only tend to have more casual sexual relationships, but they need it to ensure their wellbeing is optimum due to casual sex reducing the psychological wellbeing (Vrangalova, 2015).&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>However, most of the research has focused on the health or psychological wellbeing regarding casual sex, leading to saturation in literature. Casual sex can also cause a moral issue too, such as having an affair when in a serious relationship, which could lead to issues in relationship cohesion. There is very limited research when looking at sexual behaviour as a moral value, therefore this issue needs to be addressed. Within health psychology, the NHS is seen as the leading viewpoint of sexual behaviour. Additionally, when looking at wellbeing, psychologists have views of significance due to being experts in the field. It could be argued that when looking at the morality of sexual behaviour, religious institutions could reduce casual sex from a moral standpoint as most religions regard casual sex as an immoral behaviour, due to the historical holy texts (Hernandez-Kane &amp; Mahoney, 2018). However, religion may suggest that, by classifying sexual behaviour as an immoral behaviour, there is a likelihood of reducing casual sex, thereby increasing the wellbeing as well as the moral values of the individual.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Religion is important psychologically, as for religious individuals, it shapes their worldview, attitudes and behaviours in their daily life (Hood Jr, Hill &amp; Spilka, 2009). Evidence of this is highlighted by Kirchmaier, Prüfer &amp; Trautmann (2018) where they published that, religious people seemed to hold stronger moral values and show 40% more pro-social activity, such as volunteering and providing informal care, than non-religious people. This demonstrates that religious values can produce moral attitudes which induces the moral behaviour of volunteering and caring for others.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;There is an interesting dynamic that occurs when religion and morality come into contact. Within Abrahamic religions, it was published that there are Jewish-Protestant differences in the morality of thoughts, which are in line with the theological differences between Judaism and Christianity (Cohen, 2015). This suggests that religion can affect the morality of the individual by affecting their cognitions about certain scenarios. Further support is highlighted by Cohen &amp; Rozin (2001) who published that Jews were not concerned about the inappropriate ‘mental states’, such as disliking one’s parents, whereas protestants were extremely concerned. This suggests that moral cognitions seem to have a strong impact on the individual’s reasoning.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>However, religion and moral behaviour is not as consistent as expected as religion has also been the reason for a range of immoral behaviours. Examples of immoral behaviour in the name of religion are: the terror attacks on 9th of September 2001 and religious cleansing in both Bosnia and Sudan. Additionally, from the psychological perspective, it could be suggested that, an individual’s moral values may not follow societies values. An example of this is that people who oppose abortion from a religious standpoint, have favoured legal abortion by the state (Scott, 1989). Furthermore, 70% of Seventh-Day Adventists recognised their church’s prohibition of premarital sex, however, 54% of the same sample reported that they had engaged in premarital sex (Ali &amp; Naidoo, 1999). This demonstrates that, although associations between religion and moral behaviour can be informative, this is by far, no means an accurate prediction. Nonetheless, what is clear, is that religion does have a role in affecting the religious individual’s behaviour, therefore how religion affects the attitudes and behaviours of religious individuals needs to be addressed.</p>
								  <p>&nbsp;Additionally, religion has been based on societies and cultures that no longer have significant relevance in the modern world. One example of this, is the idea of divorce in traditional Christianity. When Christianity was emerging, women did not have equal rights and were treated as property of the husband. Therefore, divorce was seen to be unjust as it would leave the woman to fend for herself without any lawful protection. In contemporary times, this view has been removed in western society, however, divorce is still seen in a negative light amongst different religious institutions. Due to religion’s historical viewpoint, religion and sexuality have often been “intimate enemies” (Bach &amp; Wyden, 1969). An interesting phenomenon is that if an individual comes from an upbringing which is very sexually conservative, such as having a strict religious belief system, then there is a higher likelihood of being negatively affected by casual sex (Lefkowitz, Gillen, Shearer &amp; Boone, 2004). Additionally, Muhammad, Shamsuddin, Sulaiman, Amin &amp; Omar (2017) published that amongst female Muslims, being religious had a direct impact on the reduction of sexual activity of the individual. Furthermore, a longitudinal study in the USA involving young adolescence published that, by having a high religiosity trait, there is a delay in sexual intercourse (Hardy &amp; Raffaelli, 2003). All the studies highlighted suggests, there is not only a link between religion and the sexual behaviour, but that religion reduces sexually permissive behaviour. This allows the current study to determine whether there is a mediating factor between religion and sexual behaviour through moral values which religion has instilled in the individuals.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>One-way religious views on sex and morality could be transmitted is through an authority figure. In most religions, ministers are seen to have authority over a congregation of the faith and may be seen as an expert in moral values. A key area of leadership influence is through French and Raven’s (1959) bases of power. The bases of power are dimensions that determine leadership influence or compliance. These are: legitimacy, reward, coercion, reference, expert and informational (Raven, 1965). All the bases of power are socially dependent except for informational power. This further demonstrates the importance of the social interaction between a minister and the congregation. The minister is in a position of legitimate power, as they have been elected by the stationing committees authorised by the church. The minister can use reward and coercion to ensure that congregation members have equality within the church. An example of this is that, if there is a complaint within the church, the ministers can dispense justice and ensure that the situation is dealt with promptly (Wilson, 1959).&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Referent power is the likability of the individual through charisma or rapport. This is a necessary power for ministers, as they need to understand their congregation to develop a rapport and help them spiritually. Without this referent power, the minister would not have any influence on their congregation, and this would increase the chance of congregation members seeking other churches and ministers to guide them. When looking at HIV prevention in Uganda, charismatic leaders were able to directly address the threat of HIV and AIDS through national media coverage of all aspects of the epidemic, including sexual behaviour changes (Green, Halperin, Nantulya &amp; Hogle, 2006). This led to an increased awareness of HIV and AIDS and the rise of religious leaders taking to the frontlines to actively participate in AIDS education and prevention activities (Kaleeba, Kadowe, Kalinaki &amp; Williams, 2000; Kagimu, Marum, Wabwire-Mangen, Nakyanjo, Walakira &amp; Hogle, 1998; Kirby, 2008). AIDS prevention was further supported by the Anglican church delivering AIDS education messages in sermons and weddings (Green, Halperin, Nantulya &amp; Hogle, 2006). This demonstrates that charismatic leaders, through church ministers, can influence sexual behaviour change across countries.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>In terms of expert power, ministers are required to go to bible colleges to learn about theology. Only after they have graduated from this college are they able to minister a congregation (Francis, Penson &amp; Jones, 2001). This demonstrates that ministers are in a position of expertise, allowing them to influence others using their knowledge in their defined area.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Finally, informational power is defined as using information that does not belong to the individual to influence others. This type of power is not used by ministers as all the information is provided by higher powers, an example being Rome for the Roman Catholics. Therefore, ministers are able to provide information, but not keep it as their own, as the information is distilled equally throughout different congregations.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Through the understanding of the bases of power, this could be the reason as to how and why ministers have influence over the congregation. In relation to sexual health, it has been published that ministers are seen to be an essential element for health interventions (Bopp, Baruth, Peterson &amp; Webb, 2013). The minister can do this at three different prevention levels: tertiary, such as being in contact with hospitals and the individuals families, secondary by identifying sexual health disorders or primary such as leading sexual health promotion programs (Levin, 1986). This demonstrates that not only do ministers do have an influence, they can specifically impact the sexual wellbeing of their congregations.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Although there is an understanding that ministers may have the power and authority to be able to influence members of their congregations, there needs to be an understanding of the type of person that can be influenced. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to measure personality traits and minister influence. Therefore, personality traits were compared to compliance (Gudjonsson, 1989; Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, Bragason, Einarsson &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 2004) and other behaviours relating to compliance such as information seeking (Halder, Roy &amp; Chakraborty, 2017). Horney’s (2012) definition of individuals with a compliant personality is that they want to feel loved, accepted and appreciated. Individuals also want to be cared for, protected and guided by others. These individuals are sensitive to other people’s needs in their social environment.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Previous research has published that neuroticism is positively associated with compliance, whereas extraversion is negatively associated with compliance amongst 3 different sample types (Gudjonsson, Sigurdsson, Bragason, Einarsson &amp; Valdimarsdottir, 2004). It could be argued that neuroticism and introversion combined, leads to an insecure personality which would lead them to want to be accepted and guided. These facts are ideal within a religious adherence as religion is traditionally very accepting, allowing anyone to join and the minister can provide guidance to the insecure individual. Therefore, it is hypothesised that high neuroticism and low extraversion would lead to minister compliance and minister influence on individuals sexual and moral behaviour if guided on these topics.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Agreeableness was also published to have a positive association with compliance through informational seeking behaviour amongst a student population (Halder, Roy &amp; Chakraborty, 2017). Through information seeking, it could be suggested that students may go to religious ministers to increase understanding of their religion. To accept the ministers’ viewpoints, the students must be receptive to information being shared to them, therefore agreeableness needs to be measured in the current study, to see if the minister has influence on sexual attitudes and not just religious teachings.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Not only does the personality types impact the effectiveness of minister influence, the same personality types also impact the individuals’ sexual behaviour. Previous research has published that around 60% of females report compliant sexual behaviours with unwanted sexual advances such as unwanted dancing, kissing, petting, oral sex, and vaginal intercourse (Kennett, Humphreys, &amp; Bramley, 2013; O’Sullivan &amp; Allgeier, 1998). Additionally, the issue on compliance can affect males (Quinn-Nilas et al, 2013). Due to this being a recent issue, the current research is interested whether compliance is higher in congregational members leading to a change in sexual behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>When looking at personality traits from the Big Five, previous research has published that people who had a highly neurotic personality tended to have more permissive sexual attitudes (Fernandez &amp; Castro, 2003). Individuals with high neuroticism also seemed to engage in more sexual risk-taking behaviour (Eysenck, 1971; Naff Johnson, 1997) such as unsafe sexual practices (Cerwonka, Isbell &amp; Hansen, 2000), and not using a condom to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (Holmes, Levine &amp; Weaver, 2004).&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>As well as neuroticism, extraversion has also been seen to have a positive link with permissive sexual attitudes and desires (Barnes, Malamuth, &amp; Cheek, 1984; Costa, Fagan, Piedmont, Ponticas, &amp; Wise, 1992; Snyder, Simpson, &amp; Gangestad, 1986). Extraversion also has been linked to promiscuous sexual behaviour (Pinkerton &amp; Abramson, 1995; Schenk &amp; Pfrang, 1986; Schmitt &amp; Buss, 2000; Wright, 1999) and to unsafe sexual practices (McCown, 1992). The reason that extraversion is seen to be linked with permissive sexual attitudes, could be due to the individuals having a higher libido which causes them to want to have more sexual experiences.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Finally, it has also been published that low agreeableness has been linked to unrestricted sociosexual orientation (Wright and Reise, 1997). Sociosexual orientation is defined as the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a restricted sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex whereas individuals with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex, and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness (Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991). Therefore, an unrestricted sociosexual orientation is linked to permissive sexual attitudes which also suggests that low agreeableness is linked to permissive sexual behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Taking all evidence into account, the current study is interested in whether religion can influence religious members to prevent attitudes that are linked to acts such as casual sex, to increase psychological wellbeing and moral values. To tackle this, the current study focuses on Christianity. This is because previous research has focused on Christianity over all other religions (Hood Jr, Hill &amp; Spilka, 2009). Additionally, Christianity is the largest religious group in the world with 31.2% of the world population being Christian (Johnson, Zurlo, Hickman &amp; Crossing, 2015) over multiple continents, with over 38,000 denominations (Kennedy, 2011). This insures, that if religion does influence the sexual attitudes of the congregation, then Christianity’s initial influence would have the most impact globally.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Research Question and Hypothesis'</h3>
								  <p>After reviewing all the research, it can be argued that there needs to be an understanding of whether the minister has an influence on the congregation from two different perspectives. The first perspective is from the minister and whether they feel that they have influence over their congregation, or even if they should have influence. The second perspective is from the congregation members themselves. The congregation needs to evaluate their minister, to see if their minister does have an influence on them and if so, what personal factors enable this influence. Therefore, two studies were developed to tackle both instances of the research question: Do religious ministers influence the sexual attitudes and moral behaviour amongst their adherence?&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Study A aims to see whether the ministers themselves feel they can influence their congregation on sexual behaviour through moral values. Additionally, there was an interest in whether the minister had different views than the church they were employed by and which view took precedence. Study B aims to look at the congregation’s point of view on minister’s influence, as well as which personality traits lead to stronger minister influence.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Study A</h3>
								  <p>Study A looks at the minister’s beliefs in detail. This is achieved by understanding each of the minister’s stories and determining the role they play in the church. The minister provides a self-evaluation on whether they feel they influence the congregations they have pastoral care over.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Study B</h3>
								  <p>Study B looks at what the congregation think of their minister, as well as identifying their personality types and how religious they feel. These traits are correlated to see whether the minister has a significant influence over the congregation.&nbsp;</p>
								  <p>Considering all the evidence provided, it can be established that a coherent model was formed. The direct hypothesis for study B was that the variables: minister influence, charismatic leadership, moral behaviour, religiousness, compliance, openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism would have a relationship with sexual attitudes. Specifically, a positive relationship for compliance, openness to experience, extraversion and neuroticism and a negative relationship with minister influence, charismatic leadership, religiousness, moral behaviour, agreeableness and conscientiousness. As the research has highlighted two different types of sexual attitudes, namely permissive and instrumental, these attitudes will be the primary criterion variables in which the independent variables will be associated with. This will allow the current study to not only observe whether ministers do have an influence on sexual attitudes objectively, but add to the current literature in determining the differences between permissive and instrumental sexual attitudes. </p>
